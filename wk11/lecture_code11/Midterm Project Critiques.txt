- if I were to continue working on this project, I would definitely look into a more compact way
- how to work with random better 
Celine
I really liked the use of javascript and how she was able to figure out how to do that
information was clean and compact, really like the display 
I wonder how the javascript for the different displays worked

Vikki
I liked the simplicity of the site. It was a cool way to see how the complexity of her site was just through the random names 
I wished to see more of her ideation and code rather than a walk through 
I wonder how she incorporated the random generator because it seemed she used something more complex compared to an array

Grant
I liked how he customized the date with the flashing
I wish there was more information to the idea behind his idea,
I also wish the information wasn't just bunched up in the top left hand corner
- thinking into web accessibility 
I wonder how he was able to get the flashing to his date

karina
I liked how the display was you could find out what the models were wearing to match

Jack 
I liked the color pallete that he chose and how he incorporated the weather for that day 
I wish that the days were a little larger, hard to see 
I wonder how much complexity went into the display 

Yubin/Sally  
I really liked the inbox shadow - tried to figure it out myself and the display of everything
I wonder what was the reason behind the designs she made
I wish 

Sav 
I liked the way she incorporated inside jokes 
I wish the boxes were the same size since the sizes varied and more centered 
I wonder how she was able incorporate a picture slideshow

Jasmine
I like the playful look to the to do list and the style that she went with
I wish to see more information displayed because it seemed a little empty

Samar
I like the presentation and the idea behind his self care menu and how 
I wish there was more styling and margin to the display b
I wonder what the inspiration behind the project and where these memes came to surface
