    <h1> About Me </h1>
      <h2> Description </h2>
      <p>
        I am a sophomore this year studying Creative Technology and Design. I'm planning on getting a minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship.
        The reason I chose this major because I really enjoy creating art, but I was also interested in doing something engineering based, aspiring to be like my dad who is an Electrical Engineer.
        I'm looking to do my minor in Engineering Entrepreneurship because I always thought that I was diligent and organized and enjoyed the business side of companies, so I thought this minor encompasses creating good startups and being able to manage the company well.
      <br>
        I am efficient in my work, completing any task to the best of my abilities, willing to learn any new skill, and open to new ideas. Aside from work, I enjoy going on different adventures, hanging out with friends, and spending time at home watching tv shows and Chinese dramas. I would say my top things to watch are Marvel and Disney movies.
        A couple interesting facts about me is I'm easily identified by my distinct and contagious laugh, I've never been out of the country, I've lived in the same home since I was born, and my name in Chinese is based off of a Chinese story.
        How my parents chose my name is my dad really wanted to name my brother and I after the Chinese story 东山再起 <em> (make a comeback) </em>. And since I was born in the winter they used the words 冬<em>(winter)</em> 珊<em>(coral)</em>.
        For my English name, my parents liked the name <em> Shawna </em> and <em> Tor </em> sounded like our Chinese last name. So, they added <em> Tor </em> to the beginning of <em> Shawna </em> to create <strong> Torshawna </strong>.
