      <p>
        Walt Disney was created by a man named Walt Disney. He came to California from Kansas City during the summer of 1923. Disney initially created
        <br> a little girl cartoon, known as Alice's Wonderland, and became super successful from the film and started the "Alice Comedies".
        <br> On October 16, 1923, marked the date the Disney company, formerly known as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, was started (D23).
        <br>
        <br>
        Over the years, Disney was able to move his staff to a new facility, Hyperion Studio, in Hollywood and had developed a new character
        <br> named Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. After a couple years, Walt came up with a new character, as we know today, Mickey Mouse in the cartoon
        <br> <em> Steamboat Willie </em> (D23).
